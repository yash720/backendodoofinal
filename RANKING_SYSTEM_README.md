# Ranking and Leaderboard System Documentation

## Overview
This system implements a comprehensive ranking and leaderboard functionality where students earn points from taking quizzes and practice tests. The system automatically tracks scores, assigns badges, and maintains a real-time leaderboard.

## Database Changes

### Updated Student Model (`models/Student.js`)
Added new fields for ranking and scoring:

- `totalScore` (Number, default: 0) - Total points from all quizzes
- `quizScores` (Array) - Detailed quiz performance history
- `badges` (Array) - Achievement badges earned
- `rank` (Number, default: 0) - Current ranking position
- `totalQuizzesTaken` (Number, default: 0) - Number of quizzes completed
- `averageScore` (Number, default: 0) - Average score across all quizzes
- `highestScore` (Number, default: 0) - Highest single quiz score

## Badge System

### Available Badges:
- **Top Scorer** - Highest total score in the campus
- **Consistent Performer** - Average score â‰¥ 80%
- **Rising Star** - Showing improvement in recent quizzes
- **Quiz Master** - Completed 10+ quizzes

- **Knowledge Seeker** - Completed 5+ quizzes
- **First Place** - Ranked #1 overall
- **Top 10** - Ranked in top 10
- **Top 25** - Ranked in top 25

## Workflow

## Score Calculation

### Total Score
- Sum of all quiz scores taken
- Includes both practice tests and exams
- Accumulates over time

### Average Score
- Total score divided by number of quizzes taken
- Used for badge assignment and ranking ties

### Ranking Logic
1. **Primary**: Total score (highest first)
2. **Secondary**: Average score (highest first)
3. **Tertiary**: Number of quizzes taken (most first)

## Badge Assignment Logic

### Automatic Badge Assignment:
```javascript
// Perfect Score
if (student.highestScore >= 100) {
  badges.add('Perfect Score');
}

// Top Scorer (Rank #1)
if (studentRank === 1) {
  badges.add('Top Scorer');
  badges.add('First Place');
}

// Consistent Performer
if (student.averageScore >= 80) {
  badges.add('Consistent Performer');
}

// Quiz Master
if (student.totalQuizzesTaken >= 10) {
  badges.add('Quiz Master');
}
```

## Performance Trends

### Trend Calculation:
- Analyzes last 5 quiz performances
- Determines if scores are improving, declining, or stable
- Provides motivational feedback

### Trend Types:
- **Improving** - Recent scores are better than previous
- **Declining** - Recent scores are worse than previous
- **Stable** - Consistent performance

## Database Queries

### Get All Students Sorted by Score
```javascript
const allStudents = await Student.find()
  .select('name totalScore badges rank')
  .sort({ totalScore: -1, averageScore: -1 });
```

### Update Student Score
```javascript
student.quizScores.push({
  quizId,
  score,
  percentage,
  completedAt: new Date()
});

student.totalScore = student.quizScores.reduce((total, quiz) => total + quiz.score, 0);
student.averageScore = student.totalScore / student.quizScores.length;
```

### Update All Ranks
```javascript
const students = await Student.find().sort({ totalScore: -1 });
for (let i = 0; i < students.length; i++) {
  students[i].rank = i + 1;
  await students[i].save();
}
```

## Usage Examples
